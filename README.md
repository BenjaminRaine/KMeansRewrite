# KMeansRewrite
Creates a set of points in 2D space and assigns them to clusters based on their distance to randomly placed centers.
The centers are then moved and the points reassigned until a stable set of clustered points is reached.
For each center a random colour is selected and the points are made into a scatterplot with their assigned center's colour.
The scatterplot is then printed in the console
